# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: incorrect use of the $group operator. The bug results in an inaccurate count of documents, leading to faulty analysis.

## Bug Description
The original aggregation pipeline attempts to find the top 10 most frequent fields in a collection. However, due to an error in the $group stage, it produces the wrong results.

## Solution
The solution addresses the problem by correcting the $group stage and ensuring the aggregation pipeline produces the correct results.
